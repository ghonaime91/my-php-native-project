*It is an online chess learning site where you can register an account and then enroll to any course you want.
*The site has more than one role: admin - coach - player.
*The admin has a dashboard and has all the capabilities of reviewing, adding and deleting a player, coach or course.
*The coach has a mini dashboard where he can review his own courses and add and delete them.
*The player can only review the courses and enroll in them or cancel the enrollment.
